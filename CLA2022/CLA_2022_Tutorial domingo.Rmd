# How can we use FCA to build a recommender system?

The steps could be as follows:

0.  Preprocess data
1.  Extract knowledge as implications
2.  Use the closure wrt the implications as the engine to provide
    recommendations
3.  What happens when the closure does not provide an useful
    recommendation?? The Simplification Logic.

# Running example

The aim is to build an automated system using the fcaR package to
perform medical diagnosis. We have focused on neurological pathologies
since, in recent years, an increasing number of initiatives have
appeared to share, curate, and study specific, prevalent brain
pathologies. Among these pathologies, schizophrenia is of the highest
interest, and public, curated repositories have been released.

```{r echo = FALSE}
degrees <- c("absent", "minimal", "mild", "moderate", "moderate severe", "severe", "extreme")

COBRE_text <- cobre32
COBRE_text[] <- degrees[COBRE_text * 6 + 1]
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
COBRE_text[1:6, 1:8] %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", booktabs = TRUE)
```

The attributes are:

-   COSAS_n

The Simpson-Angus Scale, 7 items to evaluate Parkinsonism-like
alterations, related to schizophrenia, in an individual.

-   FICAL_n

The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, 9 items (attributes)
assessing the level of depression in schizophrenia, differentiating
between positive and negative aspects of the disease.

-   SCIDII_n

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders,
with 14 variables related to the presence of signs affecting
personality.

-   dx_ss

if TRUE, the diagnosis is strict schizophrenia.

-   dx_other

it TRUE, the diagnosis is other than schizophrenia, including
schizoaffective, bipolar disorder and major depression.

# Preprocess data

Let us scale the context "text/ordinal" -> "grade"

We have done that for you, it is the dataset that is included in the
package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
?cobre32
```

# Extract knowledge as implications

Build a formal context object:

```{r}
fc <- FormalContext$new(cobre32)
```

Use NextClosure to find the Duquenne-Guigues basis:

```{r}
fc$find_implications()
```

How many implications are there in the basis?

```{r}
fc$implications$cardinality()
```

We can inspect a few of these implications:

```{r}
fc$implications[5:9]
```

Let us save the implications in another variable to avoid long commands
from now on:

```{r}
imps <- fc$implications
```

# Use the closure wrt the implications as the engine to provide recommendations

Let us invent a new individual:

```{r}
S1 <- Set$new(attributes = fc$attributes,
              COSAS_1 = 1/2, COSAS_2 = 1, COSAS_3 = 1/2,
              COSAS_4 = 1/6, COSAS_5 = 1/2, COSAS_6 = 1)
S1
```

We can compute the closure of this set of attributes using the
implications previously computed:

```{r}
imps$closure(S1)
```

In the closure, there appears `dx_ss`, so with these symptoms, we can
conclude the diagnosis of strict schizophrenia.

We could have done the "FCA" closure, that is, using the concept-forming
operators of the formal context:

```{r}
O1 <- fc$extent(S1)
O1
fc$intent(O1)
```

Or, together, the closure operator:

```{r}
fc$closure(S1)
```

Another example:

```{r remedy001}
S2 <- Set$new(attributes = fc$attributes,
              COSAS_4 = 2/3, FICAL_3 = 1/2, 
              FICAL_5 = 1/2, FICAL_8 = 1/2)
S2
```

We can check the closure:

```{r remedy002}
fc$closure(S2)
imps$closure(S2)
```

In this case, in the closure set, there appears the attribute
`dx_other`, so this would be the desired diagnosis.

A more challenging example:

```{r remedy003}
S3 <- Set$new(attributes = fc$attributes,
              COSAS_2 = 1, COSAS_6 = 1, 
              FICAL_1 = 1/3, FICAL_3 = 1/3)
S3
```

Let us inspect the closure:

```{r remedy004}
fc$closure(S3)
imps$closure(S3)
```

Ok, there is no diagnosis attribute in the closure. What would an expert
do? The expert would take into consideration the present attributes and
ask for additional symptoms/tests to be able to arrive at a diagnosis.

# What happens when the closure does not provide an useful recommendation? Simplification Logic (SL) to the rescue!

The SL can be used to compute the closure wrt a set of implications,
providing a simplified set of implications once the original attributes
are taken away, and which is equivalent, in some sense, to the original
implication system:

The $SL_{FD}$ \code{closure} algorithm makes use of the above
equivalence rules to compute the closure $X^+$ of a set $X$ using a set
of implications $\Sigma$, and return a simplified $\Sigma'$ where the
attributes in $X^+$ do not appear, and such that:
$$\{\varnothing\smallsetminus X\}\cup \Sigma \equiv \{\varnothing\smallsetminus X^+\}\cup \Sigma'$$

```{r remedy005}
result <- imps$closure(S3, reduce = TRUE)
```

We check the closure:

```{r remedy006}
result$closure
```

We get the same information as using the classical scheme. But, in
addition, we get this simplified set of implications

```{r remedy007, eval = FALSE}
result$implications
```

The interpretation of this simplified set of implications is that if we
consider that we have all the attributes in $S3$, then it is equivalent
to the original one.

We can narrow the implications by removing redundancies (not needed, but
recommended)

```{r remedy008}
result$implications$apply_rules(c('simp', 'rsimp', 'reorder'))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
result$implications
```

An expert may be interested only in the rules from which she could
derive a diagnosis, so we can simulate that behaviour by filtering the
implications and only take into account those in whose RHS there is a
diagnosis attribute.

```{r remedy009}
result$implications$filter(rhs = c('dx_ss', 'dx_other'),
                           not_lhs = c('dx_ss', 'dx_other'), 
                           drop = TRUE)
```

What does this mean? In the LHS there are combinations of attributes
that, together those present in S3, could lead to a diagnosis. For
instance, for our patient S3, having FICAL_5 at least with degree "mild"
(0.33) would lead to `dx_other`, whereas having COSAS_3 with degree
"moderate", to `dx_ss`.

Thus, we can build a *conversational* recommender system:

1.  Provide as many *symptoms/attributes* as are known.

2.  Compute the closure using the simplification logic algorithm.

    -   If the closure contains a diagnosis attribute, stop and return
        it.
    -   If it does not, ask the *patient/user* for another attribute
        among those in the LHS of the reduced implication set. Combine
        it with the previous ones and repeat step 2.
