# Moving towards applications

How to guide an user (users) in a recommendation system?

-   Closures of preferences of the users - blindly\
-   Closures of preferences of the users - guided by attributes on the
    left-hand side of the implications
-   Preferences of the users - guided by attributes on minimal
    generators
-   Some of the above options enhanced by parallelism and/or cooperative
    user guidance

The knowledge inside the implications addresses us towards the
development of some recommender systems.

-   Based on logic which allows to manage the users' preferences by
    following a conversational paradigm.
-   Lazzy computation of minimal generators - on-demand computation of
    minimal generators by means of an algorithm with polynomial delay.

Graded implications in the framework of Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis
are used as the knowledge guiding the recommendations.

-   Conversational recommender systems have proven to be a good approach
    in telemedicine, building a dialogue between the user and the
    recommender based on user preferences provided at each step of the
    conversation.
-   We propose a conversational recommender system for medical diagnosis
    using fuzzy logic.
-   The recommender system has been used to provide differential
    diagnosis between schizophrenia and schizoaffective and bipolar
    disorders.

# First Experiment

    We import the formal context from a matrix to a  fcaR object named gradedfc.

In Table 1, we show the dataset used in these examples. The dataset
simulate a set of 8 subjects and 6 symptom attributes with degrees
ranging in [0, 1]. The symptoms are named a, b, c, d, e, f. Two possible
diseases are denoted as D1 and D2.

```{r}
library(fcaR)
mymatrix <- read.csv2("~/Github/2021_ICFCARules_MinGen_Filtering/data/data_matrix.csv")
gradedfc <- fcaR:::FormalContext$new(mymatrix)
gradedfc
plot(gradedfc)
```

> > Implications are computed using NextClosure (fuzzy version) from
> > Radim Belohlavek.

> > For classical case, Nextclosure algorithm is developed in fcaR.

> > Now, we are developing the main algorithms to compute concept
> > lattice and implications: FCbO, Fast Close-by-One, LinCbO, In-close.

```{r}
gradedfc$find_implications()
gradedfc$implications$cardinality()
gradedfc$implications
implications <- gradedfc$implications$clone()
```

This set of implications is used as the core knowledge of a
Conversational recommender.

**Iteration 1:**

We'll use the following subject data as starting point in the example
conversations:

```{r}
Subject <- Set$new(attributes =gradedfc$attributes, sparse = TRUE)
Subject$assign(attributes = c("a"),values = c(1))
Subject
```

The computed closure is:

```{r}
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure 
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
implications <- closure$implications
implications
```

This gives a total of 18 implications in this step, instead of the
initial 21 implications. As we haven't arrived to a valid class (D1, D2)
in the closure, we proceed with the next iteration.

**Iteration 2:**

The user select other attribute:

```{r}
Subject$assign(attributes = c("e"),values = c(1))
Subject
```

The computed closure is:

```{r}
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
implications <- closure$implications
implications
```

This gives a total of 12 implications in this step, instead of the
initial 21 implications. As we haven't arrived to a valid class (D1, D2)
in the closure, we proceed with the next iteration.

**Iteration 3:**

The user select other attribute:

```{r}
Subject$assign(attributes = c("b"),values = c(0.5))
Subject
```

The computed closure is:

```{r}
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
implications <- closure$implications
implications
```

This gives a total of 12 implications in this step, instead of the
initial 21 implications. As we haven't arrived to a valid class (D1, D2)
in the closure, we proceed with the next iteration.

**Iteration 4:**

The user select other attribute:

```{r}
Subject$assign(attributes = c("c"),values = c(0.5))
Subject
```

The computed closure is:

```{r}
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
implications <- closure$implications
implications
```

This gives a total of 9 implications in this step, instead of the
initial 21 implications. **In this iteration, we have arrived at a
classification/recommendation present in the current closure: D2
disease.** Thus, there is no need to make any further iteration.

# Second Experiment

This experiment has been done using the dataset named **Disease-Symptom
Knowledge Database** containing a list of diseases given to a set of
symptoms. See
<http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html>
for more information about the dataset. The data in CSV format has been
extracted from <https://github.com/anaymalpani/sytora>.

In this document, we present an idea of how closures and implications
reduced in the computation of the closures the execution traces of how
we develop the recommender system.

## Importing the dataset

```{r import dataset, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, display=FALSE}
#setwd("~/Github/2021_ICFCARules_MinGen_Filtering")
library(fcaR)
library(Matrix)
library(arules)
library(devtools)
devtools::load_all()

#FC <- read.csv("~/Github/2021_ICFCARules_MinGen_Filtering/Ejemplos-pruebas/TB_1_2.csv", header=TRUE, sep=";")


FC <- read.csv("/Volumes/GoogleDrive/Mi\ unidad/CooperativeFiltering/datasets/sytora-master/data/all-files-for-ml/all_pivoted.csv")
 

head(FC[,1:24])

# some pre-processing tasks
rownames(FC) <- FC$Disease
filas <- rownames(FC)
FC$Disease <- NULL
FC1 <-as.data.frame(sapply(FC, function(x) as.logical(x)))
#View(head(FC1))
rownames(FC) <- filas

```

The size of the dataset is:

```{r}
dim(FC)
```

## Using arules

In Machine Learning Community the most used R package to manipulate
rules is `arules`. Our R package named fcaR
(<https://github.com/Malaga-FCA-group/fcaR>) has an intersting interface
with arules:

-   **promoting Machine Learning community to approach FCA community**

We extract the rules using arules:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, display=FALSE}
rm(Rules, Rules1)
my_support <- 0.005  
rule_param = list(
  supp = my_support,
  conf = 1,
  maxlen = 25
)
Rules <- apriori(FC1,parameter = rule_param)
Rules1 <- Rules[!is.redundant(Rules)]
cat("Non-redundant rules:n")
Rules1
arules::write.PMML(Rules1,"~/Github/2021_ICFCARules_MinGen_Filtering/Rules1_DSK.pmml")

```

> > 10013234 implications extracted from the dataset using arules

> > Removing redundancy using method included in arules: 11844
> > implications

## Importing rules to fcaR

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
Rules1 <- arules:::read.PMML("~/Github/2021_ICFCARules_MinGen_Filtering/Rules1_DSK.pmml")
Rules1
fcaR_fc <- fcaR:::FormalContext$new(FC1)
fcaR_fc
plot(fcaR_fc)
fcaR_fc$implications$add(Rules1)
fcaR_fc$implications$cardinality()
head(fcaR_fc$implications)

```

## Removing redundancy

First, we emphasize that simply applying the rules of Simplification
Logic we can obtain a reduced set of implications. Using `fcaR` package
the removing of redundancy can do in the following:

```{r}
 
fcaR_fc$implications$apply_rules(rules=c("generalization", "composition", "simplification"), 
                            parallelize = TRUE)
fcaR_fc$implications$cardinality()
implications <- fcaR_fc$implications$clone() 
head(implications)
```

## Using closures

This set of implications is used as the core knowledge of a recommender
system.

> > We simulate a conversation process with a doctor trying to identify
> > a disease. For instance, objects could be POI (points of interest)
> > in a touristic place and attributes some desired features for a

We'll use the following subject data as starting point in the example
conversations:

```{r}
Subject <- Set$new(attributes =fcaR_fc$attributes, sparse = TRUE)
Subject$assign(attributes = c("C0022107"),values = c(1))
Subject
```

**Iteration 1:**

The computed closure is:

```{r}
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure$closure
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
head(closure$implications)
```

This gives a total of `r closure$implications$cardinality()`
implications in this step, instead of the initial
`r fcaR_fc$implications$cardinality()` implications.

With this closure we could identify:

```{r}
      objects  <-  fcaR_fc$extent(closure$closure)
      objects
```

**Iteration 2:**

The doctor selects a new attribute:

```{r}
Subject$assign(attributes = c("C0455769"),values = c(1))
Subject

closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure$closure
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
head(closure$implications)
```

This gives a total of `r closure$implications$cardinality()`
implications in this step, instead of the initial
`r fcaR_fc$implications$cardinality()` implications.

With this closure we could identify:

```{r}
      objects  <-      fcaR_fc$extent(closure$closure)
      objects
```

**Iteration 3:**

The doctor selects a new attribute:

```{r}
Subject$assign(attributes = c("C0237154"),values = c(1))
Subject
closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure$closure
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
head(closure$implications)
```

This gives a total of `r closure$implications$cardinality()`
implications in this step, instead of the initial
`r fcaR_fc$implications$cardinality()` implications.

With this closure we could identify:

```{r}
       objects  <-  fcaR_fc$extent(closure$closure)
      objects
```

**Iteration 4:**

The doctor selects a new attribute

```{r}
Subject$assign(attributes = c("C0235198"),values = c(1))
Subject

closure <- implications$closure(Subject,reduce = TRUE)
closure$closure
```

After applying Simplification Logic, the resulting set of simplified
implications is:

```{r}
head(closure$implications)
```

This gives a total of `r closure$implications$cardinality()`
implications in this step, instead of the initial
`r fcaR_fc$implications$cardinality()` implications.

With this closure we have identified the disease:

```{r}
      objects  <-  fcaR_fc$extent(closure$closure)
      objects$print()
```
